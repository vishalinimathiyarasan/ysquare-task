Algorithm:

1. create the Calculator interface with the power(a, b) method signature.

2. Create the PowerCalculator class that implements the Calculator interface.
   In the power(a, b) method:
  Check if either a or b is negative. If so, throw an exception.
   Calculate the power using Math.pow(a, b) and round the result to one decimal place.

 3. ExceptionHanding program:
   Parse the two command-line arguments as doubles.
  Create an instance of PowerCalculator.
  Call the power(a, b) method and catch any exceptions that are thrown.
  Print the result if the calculation is successful, or print an error message if an exception occurs.
