Algorithm:

1.create an Account class with fields id, accountNumber, and accountBalance.
2.Define a User class with fields id, userName, password, email, and account (type: Account).
3.Create a list (e.g., ArrayList) to store created users.
4.Display a menu with options:
   "Create User"
   "Show Users"
   "Exit"
5.If the user selects "Create User":
   Prompt the user to enter user information (id, user_name, password, email).
   Prompt the user to enter account information (id, account_number, account_balance).
   Create an Account object and a User object with the entered information.
   Add the created user to the list.
6.If the user selects "Show Users":
   Iterate through the list of users and display their information.
7.If the user selects "Exit", terminate the program.
